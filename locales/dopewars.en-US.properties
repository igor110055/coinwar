about-text = Drugwars is a turn-based strategy computer game in which the player assumes the role of a drug dealer engaged in arbitrage. The object of the game is to deal the most drugs to pay off the "loan shark" (who charges interest) by the end of the game and make a profit. Inspired by the text-based BASIC game Star Trader, Drugwars was originally an MS-DOS program created by John E. Dell in 1984.Over the years a few variations of the original game by John E. Dell have been released. Dope Wars for Windows from Beermat Software, an adaption of the original DOS source code, proved to be one of the most popular versions. Available from 1998 to early 2005 on CNET's download.com, this version was downloaded over 6,500,000 times and was listed in the "50 Most Popular Games" section weekly, for over 6 years. Beermat Software revived the same game for the Android platform on November 13, 2015 and for iOS on June 27, 2017, available now on Google Play and the Apple App Store, for phones and tablets. Other versions include Dope Wars, a popular version of the game written by Ben Webb. Another popular version is Drug Wars - Underworld; a fantasy-themed version called Dragon Trader also exists. In 1998, Michael Swain released a modified port of the original TI-82 Drug Wars, for the TI-83 and TI-83+ graphing calculators. In 1999, Jason Roberts released a version for the TI-83 called DrugWars 2: International that added RPG elements which included fights with cops. In 1995, a TI-Basic game titled pimpwars was released for the TI-82 that included new features such as sex trade, drug addiction management, and a simple driving simulation.  A variation on Drugwars also exists in the Nintendo DS game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars where the player can buy 6 different kinds of drugs from various gangs in Liberty City. Price trends are displayed on a map and the player gets informed of good prices via an in-game email system.  There have been various incarnations of this game. There are web-based versions, cell phone versions, a Windows client, a Linux client, a Palm OS version (Dope Wars), a version for the Newton MessagePad 2100, and a version for the Mac OS X Dashboard. Zynga developed a version of the game for social networking websites, such as Myspace. Their version changes some mechanics of the game. Zynga's rendition of Dope Wars took the basic layout of the original game and turned it into an MMORPG style game with user interaction. The player's objectives are to deal drugs, hire live workers, fight with them for cash in fight club, gamble in the casino, and travel the world while doing missions and building their cartel. Zynga discontinued this game in early December 2009.
